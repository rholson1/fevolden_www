	<h2>Our Herd</h2>
	<p>A variety of bloodlines including Hemingway, Caligula, Victor and Royal Fawn can be found in the pedigree of our alpacas.  With colors ranging from true black to the brightest white and even a &#8220;lavender&#8221; rose grey, there is an alpaca for everyone in our herd.</p>
	<p>Our alpacas enjoy interacting with people and get a lot of human contact through their day-to-day care.  Farm visits, shows, parades and other events have also helped our herd become very &#8220;sociable&#8221;.</p>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>We are committed to providing customers of Fevolden Farm with ongoing support and advice.  We are here to help you succeed.  As a hands-on operation we will be happy to teach you the ins and outs of animal care, fiber processing, and animal training.  We have learned a great deal over the years from educational seminars, veterinarians, other farms and from the alpacas themselves, and we love to pass that knowledge along.</p>

      <h2>Our Family</h2>
      <p>Fevolden Farm is a family business, raising Huacaya alpacas since 2002.  It is located in west central Wisconsin, on the farm settled by Tom and Becky&#8217;s great-grandfather Ole Fevolden in 1869.</p>
      <p>We have made many wonderful friends in the alpaca industry and look forward to making many more in the future.  Networking with other small farms and newcomers has proven very beneficial to us, and provided us with the insight and knowledge that is indispensible to the success of our operation.</p>
      <p>We invite you to visit us and become a part of our alpaca family.</p>
